Show unique first names from the patients table which only occurs once in the list.

For example, if two or more people are named 'John' in the first_name column then don't include their name in the output list. If only 1 person is named 'Leo' then include them in the output.

Solution 1
select first_name
from (select first_name, count(first_name) as cnt
     	from patients
     	group by first_name)
where cnt = 1

Solution 2
select first_name
from patients
group by first_name
having count(first_name) = 1
